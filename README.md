## Overview

This is my first advanced project from Frontend Mentor, and it was a really great experience. Some features took time to get right, and I got to try out tricks I knew but never had the chance to use before. Overall, I learned a lot and enjoyed building it, challenging, but really rewarding.

I added a few extra features beyond the original challenge:
- Saved theme preference in local storage.
- Updated the region filter to include an “All” option.
- Added a scroll-to-top button.
- Remembered scroll position so users return to the same spot on the homepage.
- Used an updated version of the data JSON.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*
